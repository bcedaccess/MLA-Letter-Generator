    'Education Assistants play a crucial role in our education system – they support all students, and ' +
    'predominantly children with disabilities. To date, there are no standards of practice for Education ' +
    'Assistants in BC. Provincially mandated standards of practice for Education Assistants are overdue. ' +
    'Standards will contribute to a high quality of education and ultimately will protect all children. \n\n' +
    'As a vital member of the teaching team, Education Assistants need consistent training prior to being ' +
    'hired, along with better working conditions.\n\n' +
    'At this point, post-secondary education programs for Education Assistants vary so greatly that skill sets ' +
    'are inconsistent. Current programs range from 2 weeks to 45 weeks in length. With this extreme ' +
    'variation, Education Assistants do not begin their careers with the same skill sets. This directly impacts ' +
    'all students, their families, and the education team.\n\n' +
    'There are risks associated with not having standards of practice for Education Assistants. Students are at ' +
    'risk of not meeting their potential for success, may experience trauma, physical harm or PTSD. ' +
    'According to Worksafe BC 1 , staff are also put at risk of physical, mental, and emotional harm including ' +
    'PTSD.\n\n' +
    'Teachers, nurses, health care aides, and even nail technicians have standards of practice. Early ' +
    'Childhood Educators (ECE) – a parallel discipline to Education Assistants – also have standards of ' +
    'practice currently regulated by our provincial government. The framework exists. Any work that is ' +
    'required of a person that impacts the wellbeing of others and that involves potential risk to themselves, ' +
    'has standards of practice, that is, except for Education Assistants. This is a safety issue. This is ' +
    'unacceptable.\n\n' +
    'Consistently educated, knowledgeable Education Assistants, that have met provincial standards prior to ' +
    'being hired, will contribute to better educational outcomes while reducing harm and trauma.\n\n' +
    'As my MLA, I am urging you to strongly advocate to the BC Government and insist they work with ' +
    'stakeholders to create provincially mandated standards of practice for Education Assistants. ' +
